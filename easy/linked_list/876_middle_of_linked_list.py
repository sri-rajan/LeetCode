# Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

# If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [3,4,5]
# Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: [4,5,6]
# Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.


# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
# 1 <= Node.val <= 100

def middleNode(head):
    fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        head = head.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return head


LinkedList = createListNodeFromArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
answer = middleNode(LinkedList)
print("this is answer")
