# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.


# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,5]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
# Output: [2,3]


# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
